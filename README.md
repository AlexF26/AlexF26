Front-End Developer
-------------------

I have a background in the B2B industry and have accumulated six years of experience in design and development roles. Over the past few years, I have transitioned into a Front-End Development role, specializing in React, GraphQL, and TypeScript. I enjoy creating new features, and having spent time understanding the ins and outs of the B2B landscape, I find myself in a great position to connect business requirements with creative technical solutions.
